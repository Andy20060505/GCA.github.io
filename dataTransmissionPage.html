      <h2>Simplex Data Transmission</h2>

      <p> Examples: Sending data from the keyboard to the CPU.</p>

      <h2>Half Duplex Data Transmission</h2>
      <p>Half-duplex data transmission is in both directions but not at the same time(data can be sent from 'A' to 'B' or from 'B' to 'A' along the same line ,but not at the same time).It allows data to travel in both directions, however, it cannot occur simultaneously.This means that data can only travel one way at a time. </p>
      <p> Examples: Walkie talkies only allow communication one way at a time. </p>
